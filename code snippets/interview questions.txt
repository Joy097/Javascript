1. wahts is hoisting
2. difference of map and objects
3. difference of function parameter and arguments
= function a (x,y){}; x and y parameter. a(3,2) here, 3 and 2
 is argument. 
4. what is window?
= the mother object. And java is all about objects.
5. how to get array max?
= using apply
6. What is closure ?
= closure is a function, having access to the parent scope
 even after the parent function has closed. Here, the
 counter in temporary is kept in a location to use later
 and in this way, user can access a variable of that scope
 outside the scope using closure.

function temporary() {
    let counter = 0;

    return function () {
        counter += 1;
    }
  }
let add = temporary();
add();

generally we cant call a function outside the scope. But
closure helps to do that. Here, we are returning a function
in the variable add. Now we can call that inside function
of that scope from outside. Because the closure is created
and it keeps the counter variable inside closure so the 
user can use it later on. 

7. difference of method and function?
= method is like a function but stays in class and to call
it, we have to use the object's name. But function is independent.

8. why we use get function instead of just function?
= because using get we do not have to use parntheses like,
car.call(). But we can use it like a property, car.call

9. what is callback?
= callback is putting a function as a parameter inside another function.
10. What is async? (means, I will finish later)
= normally js works synchronously or line by line. But
we can make it asynchronous by using setTimeout function 
and skip that to use later on.
11. You can only give just the function name without '()'
or a new whole function as the callback
12. What is call back hell?
= we know, when we have to call back a function inside another function,
then we usually put the whole function or the name. But as we
have to callback several function, so we put the whole function
and give another function inside that. Like: 
enroll(function(){
    progress(getCertificate);
})
**because enroll(progress(getCertificate)) is not possible
But what if there are multiple functions! then we have to do:
enroll(function(){
    progress(function(){
        C(function(){
            D(function(){
                E(function(){
                    F(function(){
                        G(Goes on...);
                    });
                });
            });
        });
    });
})
This is callback hell

13. Promise is better than callback. But async-await is better than Promise
14. mentioning async means that function is surely Promise
15. DOM(Document Object Model) can:
    - change html elements
    - change html attributes(type, class)
    - change css style
    - add html element and attributes
    - remove html element and attributes
    - react to html event(onclick etc.)
16. Is it possible to have multiple id in a web page? - No
17. document.getElementById and document.querySelector is same
18. Normally css works instantly and shows with the changes. but js works after the page is loaded  
19. Js is a single threaded language
