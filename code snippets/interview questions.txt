1. wahts is hoisting
2. difference of map and objects
3. difference of function parameter and arguments
= function a (x,y){}; x and y parameter. a(3,2) here, 3 and 2
 is argument. 
4. what is window?
= the mother object. And java is all about objects.
5. how to get array max?
= using apply
6. What is closure ?
= closure is a function, having access to the parent scope
 even after the parent function has closed. Here, the
 counter in temporary is kept in a location to use later
 and in this way, user can access a variable of that scope
 outside the scope using closure.

function temporary() {
    let counter = 0;

    return function () {
        counter += 1;
    }
  }
let add = temporary();
add();

generally we cant call a function outside the scope. But
closure helps to do that. Here, we are returning a function
in the variable add. Now we can call that inside function
of that scope from outside. Because the closure is created
and it keeps the counter variable inside closure so the 
user can use it later on.
