1. wahts is hoisting
2. difference of map and objects
3. difference of function parameter and arguments
= function a (x,y){}; x and y parameter. a(3,2) here, 3 and 2
 is argument. 
4. what is window?
= the mother object. And java is all about objects.
5. how to get array max?
= using apply
6. What is closure ?
= closure is a function, having access to the parent scope
 even after the parent function has closed. Here, the
 counter in temporary is kept in a location to use later
 and in this way, user can access a variable of that scope
 outside the scope using closure.

function temporary() {
    let counter = 0;

    return function () {
        counter += 1;
    }
  }
let add = temporary();
add();

generally we cant call a function outside the scope. But
closure helps to do that. Here, we are returning a function
in the variable add. Now we can call that inside function
of that scope from outside. Because the closure is created
and it keeps the counter variable inside closure so the 
user can use it later on. 

7. difference of method and function?
= method is like a function but stays in class and to call
it, we have to use the object's name. But function is independent.

8. why we use get function instead of just function?
= because using get we do not have to use parntheses like,
car.call(). But we can use it like a property, car.call

9. what is callback?
= callback is putting a function as a parameter inside another function.
10. What is async? (means, I will finish later)
= normally js works synchronously or line by line. But
we can make it asynchronous by using setTimeout function 
and skip that to use later on.
